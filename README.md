# MultiLaunch
```
Do you not have a desktop, taskbar, or startmenu to quickly launch programs from? 
Do you dislike their intuitive design or functionality? 
Do you want the icons of your programs to be stretched to hideous sizes?

This might be of some use to you.
```

## What is this
```
Launcher for programs. 
Saves the executables you put in it so you can run them and stop them all from this monstrosity.
Think start menu but incredibly ugly and unruly.
```
## Why did I make this
```
I made this before I figured out what a startmenu, taskbar, desktop, or file explorer was.
```

## How to use
```
Click add program and browse to the executable you want or drag executables onto the buttons to change them.
Click on a program to run that program, a green loading bar shows its running.
Right click a program to see more options.
Don't touch the debug button or it sends me all your crypto.
```
